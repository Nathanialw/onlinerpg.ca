-multiple players per world working together
-psuedo turn based like final fantasy 7
-keep it single page

constraints
-attacks are linear axis spells/arrows, instant spells, and melee instant
-MAYBE diagonal projectiles, not sure yet
-enemies walk direct at and attack, no AI
-only NSEW movement
-only ASCI chars
-relatively small maps (256x256 tiles?)
  only send a chunk of the map at a time to the browser equal to vision radius
-simple goal go deeper into the dungeon get loot
-can only click on one unit at a time
-minimal UI
  player frame
  target frame
  spells
  bag
  stats
-simple grid collision
-fixed damage (maybe random damage later)
  -possible random damage added on a server response after an attack (Seal of Command-like)
-dialogue box to show happenings (enemy deaths, acquired items)



gamey
-items like throwing, but they need to be very strong or even 
    necessary otherwise people won't use them
-XP
-skills get weaker against higher level enemies 
    as you level up you need to put more points into them to keep effective
    but they stay effeective against low level enemies
    means you are strong at low levels and then have to specialize later
-have the viewport sit in the window with the UI elements below 
    and the name of the game above
-time
  -time in caves passes slower than on the surface



short term:
-enemies to follow between map chunks with pathing
-login and db to save game state
-spells 
  -1 for species
  //-1 for subspecies
  -4 class
  -1 for alignment
    -// can swap these out if you find books of spells, but can only know a max num of spells

-come up with a list of spells

-text feedback for actions
-time system
  -1 move/attack = 1 minute
  -rest = 10 mins and heals one health | unless you get attacked
-scroll bar on the combat log
-fog of war/vision blocking by terrain
-right click on map will move to that location, server will send the move updates one at a time
-crate unit locations to place on map ie. ogre mound with ogre around itw

-get traits from server as IDs and fetch the IDs from the db to get the trait names and descriptions
-add a action bar
-add a spellbook
-add a spell
-add functionality to move a spell onto the action bar

medium term:
-traits based on the unit's parents and what it does while alive


long term:
-mines to enter
-build buildings
-store world state in db
-proc gen maps
-simple enemy AI


bugs:
  possible bug: when you equip an item that increases your vision at the edge of the map it will not laod the new chunk 
                  then crashes when you try to walk onto it, need to test
  pathing stops if target location is inaccessible, it should just find the closest cell and go there


unit ideas:
  totems ex.  Totem of Healing, heals all neady units
              Totem of Undeath, resurects dead units to zombies



^ = tree
. = empty space
a-z A-Z = units
Ã´ = item

-enemies walk direct at and attack, no AI
-only NSEW movement
-only ASCI chars
-relatively small maps (256x256 tiles?)

  stats
-simple grid collision
-fixed damage (mayvbe random damage later)
  -possible random damage added on a server response after an attack (Seal of Command-like)
-dialogue box to show happenings (enemy deaths, acquired items)



gamey
-items like throwing, but they need to be very strong or even 
    necessary otherwise people won't use them
-XP
-skills get weaker against higher level enemies 
    as you level up you need to put more points into them to keep effective
    but they stay effeective against low level enemies
    means you are strong at low levels and then have to specialize later
-have the viewport sit in the window with the UI elements below 
    and the name of the game above


short term:
-spells 
  -1 for species
  //-1 for subspecies
  -1 class
  -1 for alignment

-player id so you can have your own game
-when holding down move, if it colides into a unit. just stop instead of attacking
-come up with a list of spells

-if the data is already loaded it doesn't fetch it again, unless there is new info to grab
-text feedback for actions
-time system
  -1 move/attack = 1 minute
  -rest = 10 mins and heals one health | unless you get attacked
-expand the map into a grid of maps
-have enemies drop an item when they die

medium term:
-items
-UI equipment
-UI bags
-UI spells
-UI status
-traits based on the unit's parents and what it does while alive


long term:
-store world state in db
-proc gen maps
-simple enemy AI





bugs:
  pathing stops if target location is inacceible, it should just find the closest cell and go there
